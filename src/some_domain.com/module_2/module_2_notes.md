### Module 2: Functions

- Functions in Go can have multiple return values
- We can pass go function just like any other type, similar to javascript
- We can declare function inside of other functions
-- This gives us closure behavior

When declaring a function, much like variables, the name of params comes first, then the type:
```go
func foo(some_number int){
  // ...
}
```
